# TDM Audio Protocol

A small example of a TDM protocol implementation (output and masters clock only for the moment), based on the excellent I2S example from https://github.com/malacalypse/rp2040_i2s_example.

In this example, it outputs 4 sine waves at different frequencies over 8 channels.

TDM, 8 slots, 32 bits frames, 24 bits audio data, left-aligned, 48 kHz, master mode.

WIP....
