# TDM Audio Protocol

A small example of a TDM protocol implementation (output only for the moment), based on the excellent I2S example from https://github.com/malacalypse/rp2040_i2s_example.

In this example, it outputs a sine wave at 220Hz over  8 channels.

TDM, 8 slots, 32 bits frames, 24 bits data, left-aligned, 48 kHz, master mode.

WIP....
